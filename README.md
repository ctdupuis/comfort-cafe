# Comfort Café

![Demo Screenshot](home_page.png)

The Comfort Café is an app designed around the idea of a restaurant. This is purely conceptual and does not exist in the real world as an actual business. While working on this project, I asked my fiancee to treat me like she was my client, making changes and developing features to meet her requests.

## Features

- Authentication and authorization
- Order placement and order history tracking
- Dynamic menu page with filters based on food categories
- Data validation to prevent users from persisting incomplete or malicious data
- Styling scales for mobile
