                        <p>We're regular people that had a dream to bring great food to the people of the Acadiana Area. Local resident and Head of Operations Miah Harrell opened Comfort Café with the help of her better half Cody Dupuis. Together, they planted the café seed in November 2021 and have since watched it blossom in only a few short months. We owe it all to you, the Lafayette residents. Without you, this dream would've remained nothing but a dream and for that, we say thank you.</p>

                        <p>It's in the title: Comfort! We aim to deliver a calm, soothing atmosphere and some delicious comfort food. An important topic that came up in the planning of the stages was inclusion. We want people of all backgrounds to feel like they have a place at our café and reflect that in our menu. From meat-lovers to vegetarians and vegans, our menu has a wide variety of options for everybody! We also aim to draw in people of all musical tastes by allowing them to connect their phones to a bluetooth speaker on each table! Listen to your tunes for your meal. The speakers are locked at volume and can be adjusted to meet different needs so we ask that you be courteous of others and if you decide to refuse, well then it really wasn't up to you anyway. So what are you waiting for? Are you stressed? Of course you are! Won't stress make you hungry? OF COURSE IT WILL! Come comfort yourself with mouth-watering foods that you can customize to suit your tastes and needs.</p>

                        <p>Miah insisted that in order to reach maximum comfort levels for our customers, we have opened a pet-friendly patio section of the restaurant for people to bring their fur babies. We keep pet water bowls in the café at all times to help your beloved pets deal with that harsh, dry Lousiana heat. Why should Fido have to stay home alone while you go out to eat? Well thanks to us, he doesn't have to, so grab your Fido and your pants and come on down! <em>(Shirts and shoes are required by state law)</em></p>
